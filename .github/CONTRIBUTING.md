## Pull requests
Before submitting a pull request, please check that the changes don't effect other platforms or have any unwanted
side-effects.

Pull Requests should address open issue(s), where the project owner and contributors can discuss how the issue should be
addressed.

Pull requests that add new features should be first mentioned in issues in order to verify that the project owner will
allow such changes to the project.

Code in pull requests should meet the following standards:

* Class names should be CamelCase, and the first letter should be capital.
* Functions should be camelCase, and the first letter should be lower-case.
* Class members should be prefixed with `m_`, for example: `bool m_isRunning`
* All variables, classes, functions and class members should have an indicative name.
* Adding external libraries is allowed, but frowned upon
